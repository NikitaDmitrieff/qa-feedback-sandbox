# Fix-Build Agent Instructions

## CRITICAL: HEADLESS mode. NO human interaction.

- NEVER use brainstorming skill
- NEVER call AskUserQuestion
- NEVER use EnterPlanMode
- Fix ONLY the issues identified in the review feedback
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code
- Do NOT add new features
- Make minimal, targeted fixes
