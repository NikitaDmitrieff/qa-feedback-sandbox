# Builder Agent Instructions

## CRITICAL: You are running in HEADLESS mode. There is NO human to interact with.

- NEVER use the brainstorming skill — skip it entirely
- NEVER call AskUserQuestion — there is no one to answer
- NEVER present designs or options for approval — just implement
- NEVER use EnterPlanMode — go straight to writing code
- DO use implementation skills (frontend-design, TDD, writing-plans) if they help
- DO be creative and bold with the implementation — the spec is your guide
- Start writing code IMMEDIATELY after reading the codebase
- Your output is judged by what you SHIP, not what you plan
